see if I can rework the map to load with USA then switch to their location if that works.
now, need to display the current event in myEvent and add it to the Events db.
Then, create the user - add this to their list of meeting places.

Next steps:

1. Get geolocation working. Add event address to the Event model.
2. Get the /profile page working
3. Get cleanup for older-than-a-day (less 1 hour) events -mark events that have already started... add a 'keep this event posted for an hour past when it starts' checkbox, automatically checked
4. Implement users in events and user validation

Further features:
1. Implement flags
2. Implement questions and answers, forum style

So, going forward - just the websocket issue for now. I'll leave that till later as a minor bug.


ok. I have myEvent showing to the screen properly.
I need to get new events being pushed to the screen with sockets.
