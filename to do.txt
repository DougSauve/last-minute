Maybe I should make location the last slide. I'll make it the 3rd. X
Wire up user account creation on landing page X
Landing page needs a filtered list of events X
Reorganize /events form to have 4 slides instead of its current layout X
Figure out how to make a geolocation map show up X
Hosted event needs to persist between sessions - good in db but not in redux. X
Need to get redux.events updating on createEvent. myEvent does, but not events. X
submitEvent not working X
incorrect login freaks out X
duplicate sign up doesn't do anything X
/myEvents edit event says it created event - just the wording is wrong. X
wire up meetingPlaces X
duplicate meetingPlaces don't get made X
updating events is adding new events to hosted and attending. Needs to update the existing one instead. X
-subset, I think: updating events updates myEvent; it creates new /events in redux. (yep) X
- subset, I think: delete event is removing event from db, but not from redux/session. *This is because of hosted events. (partly.) X
add 'internet required' modals for online actions - got createEvent, createMeetingPlace... more as I go, I'm sure. :)X
/index showDetails doesn't show map by default, requires a button click that doesn't work with no internet
Unjoin not working X
subset: /events / can't attend anymore doesn't do anything. (partly) X
create 'remove event' option that shows instead of join/unjoin on own event in /index X
implement this on /events attending events list as well X
style /events, including the map modal; then implement that into /index maps X
implement homeLocations X
in /index.detailsModal, have 'show map' open its own modal with the address and place name on it, and a close button. X
Create new meeting place should do the same thing. X
/landing.signupmodal keys need line-height or flex adjusted. X
in sign up, choose homelocation. Enter address or postal code, and mouseOver explain why - 'used to find events near you' X
make footer stop being stupid X
Implement homeLocations and distance calculations to decide which events to show X
/events 'i can't attend anymore' can't show up on own event X
remove own event from attendingEvents in /events X
fix background in /events again X
show full date of event in /myevents/attendingEventsList X
prevent scrolling while modal is open, have modal show in current position X
screenshot of /events on /landing X
users shouldn't be able to join an event with the cap met X
add sign-up greeting/orientation modal X
Updates of any sort (notes) need to update to attending users. This happens with attendingEvents - just transfer it to general event changes! X
rework deleting events and what that does on associated users. X



Next steps:

Style responsively
Hash passwords
