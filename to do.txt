updating events is adding new events to hosted and attending. Needs to update the existing one instead.
- subset, I think: delete event is removing event from db, but not from redux/session. *This is because of hosted events.
-subset, I think: updating events updates myEvent; it creates new /events in redux.


add 'internet required' modals for online actions - got createEvent,

/events / can't attend anymore doesn't do anything.

/index / see details - map hangs.

Age range should only be changed once every 5 years.

create 'remove event' option that shows instead of join/unjoin on own event in /index

are join/unjoin working?

Make sure that when a user joins an event (or a second one) it reminds them their myEvent first.

I need to get new events being pushed to the screen with sockets. They get added to the db immediately - just need to broadcast these to redux state for all users.

Need to get redux.events updating on createEvent. myEvent does, but not events.
