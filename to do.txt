Maybe I should make location the last slide. I'll make it the 3rd. X
Wire up user account creation on landing page X
Landing page needs a filtered list of events X
Reorganize /events form to have 4 slides instead of its current layout X
Figure out how to make a geolocation map show up X
Hosted event needs to persist between sessions - good in db but not in redux. X
Need to get redux.events updating on createEvent. myEvent does, but not events. X

submitEvent not working X
incorrect login freaks out X
duplicate sign up doesn't do anything X
/myEvents edit event says it created event - just the wording is wrong. X

wire up meetingPlaces X
duplicate meetingPlaces don't get made X
updating events is adding new events to hosted and attending. Needs to update the existing one instead. X
-subset, I think: updating events updates myEvent; it creates new /events in redux. (yep) X
- subset, I think: delete event is removing event from db, but not from redux/session. *This is because of hosted events. (partly.) X
add 'internet required' modals for online actions - got createEvent, createMeetingPlace... more as I go, I'm sure. :)X
/index showDetails doesn't show map by default, requires a button click that doesn't work with no internet
Unjoin not working X
subset: /events / can't attend anymore doesn't do anything. (partly) X
create 'remove event' option that shows instead of join/unjoin on own event in /index X
implement this on /events attending events list as well X




Later on things:

Major:

Implement homeLocations and distance calculations to decide which events to show

Minor:

Age range should only be changed once every 5 years.
Make sure that when a user joins an event (or a second one) it reminds them their myEvent first.
I need to get new events being pushed to the screen with sockets. They get added to the db immediately - just need to broadcast these to redux state for all users.
