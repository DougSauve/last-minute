Maybe I should make location the last slide. I'll make it the 3rd. X
Wire up user account creation on landing page X
Landing page needs a filtered list of events X
Reorganize /events form to have 4 slides instead of its current layout X
Figure out how to make a geolocation map show up X
Hosted event needs to persist between sessions - good in db but not in redux. X
Need to get redux.events updating on createEvent. myEvent does, but not events. X
submitEvent not working X
incorrect login freaks out X
duplicate sign up doesn't do anything X
/myEvents edit event says it created event - just the wording is wrong. X
wire up meetingPlaces X
duplicate meetingPlaces don't get made X
updating events is adding new events to hosted and attending. Needs to update the existing one instead. X
-subset, I think: updating events updates myEvent; it creates new /events in redux. (yep) X
- subset, I think: delete event is removing event from db, but not from redux/session. *This is because of hosted events. (partly.) X
add 'internet required' modals for online actions - got createEvent, createMeetingPlace... more as I go, I'm sure. :)X
/index showDetails doesn't show map by default, requires a button click that doesn't work with no internet
Unjoin not working X
subset: /events / can't attend anymore doesn't do anything. (partly) X
create 'remove event' option that shows instead of join/unjoin on own event in /index X
implement this on /events attending events list as well X
style /events, including the map modal; then implement that into /index maps X
implement homeLocations X
in /index.detailsModal, have 'show map' open its own modal with the address and place name on it, and a close button. X
Create new meeting place should do the same thing. X
/landing.signupmodal keys need line-height or flex adjusted. X
in sign up, choose homelocation. Enter address or postal code, and mouseOver explain why - 'used to find events near you' X
make footer stop being stupid X
Implement homeLocations and distance calculations to decide which events to show X
/events 'i can't attend anymore' can't show up on own event X
remove own event from attendingEvents in /events X
fix background in /events again X
show full date of event in /myevents/attendingEventsList X
prevent scrolling while modal is open, have modal show in current position X
screenshot of /events on /landing X
users shouldn't be able to join an event with the cap met X
add sign-up greeting/orientation modal X
Updates of any sort (notes) need to update to attending users. This happens with attendingEvents - just transfer it to general event changes! X
rework deleting events and what that does on associated users. X
Hash passwords X
Age range should only be changed once every 5 years. X
Add user authentication X - I'm going to call this done since I've done it client-side through persisting state.
change password needs to have its own route, not updateUser. Make this work properly. X
Enter/escape binding are getting really messy between modals. What is going on here. In Landing, anyway. X
add enter sensors to modals (/events left, unmounting ones in /profile... look in profile. I don't want different actions getting scrambled up between the modals - that's probably what was happening before.) X
Change age range modal is submitting the form. X
add autoFocus in all modals X
July 9th:
map in create event has no manners. K, now it has manners but escape and enter aren't working in it. X
unhandled promise rejection in /events when deleting event, repeating X
joinEvents and leaveEvents broken X
bind enter to searchPreferences in /index X
add removeMeetingPlaces in MeetingPlaceList X
possible to sign up without choosing a homeLocation X not anymore
prevent map buttons from being spammed (all buttons, really.) Can I use refs? Probably. Does it actually matter? Probably not. Can I add an off-on switch at mounting, so if you click it again it retries? X
remove console.logs X
make sure all error and success messages show properly X
remove a user's hosted events when deleting profile... or ask them to do it first. :) I'll do that. X

Functionality is complete. :)

Next steps:


Style responsively
accessibility
